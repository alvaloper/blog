You can do it in just 2 minutes. Letâ€™s do it:

First, run your console and type the following as root superuser:

sudo apt -y install gsmartcontrol

Enjoy!

To uninstall only the gsmartcontrol package we can use the following command:

sudo apt-get remove gsmartcontrol

If you want to remove all dependencies of the program

sudo apt-get -y autoremove gsmartcontrol

Thanks!
