The deuces are wild today as one of the grandest palindromes of 2022 arrives on Tuesday, unofficially known as "Twosday."

Feb. 22, 2022, is written out numerically is 2/22/22. Not only is it a palindrome because it reads the same forward and backward, but what makes it special is the date has all twos. It will also be the same no matter what part of the world you're in, regardless of whether your country uses the day-month-year or year-month-day format.

It also will be on a Tuesday, (and 290 years after George Washington was born). The date is so rare the National Weather Service says a "Twosday" won't happen again for another 400 years, in 2422. 

The ultimate palindrome will occur at 2:22 a.m. or p.m., or at 22:22 military time.
