>Google Chrome is a cross-platform web browser developed by Google. It was first released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, built with free software components from Apple WebKit and Mozilla Firefox.[14] It was later ported to Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android, where it is the default browser.[15] The browser is also the main component of ChromeOS, where it serves as the platform for web applications.
